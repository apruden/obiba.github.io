<p>This story is an impressive example of use of the OBIBA software to create a federated database enabling advanced analysis without divulging any individual-level data.</p>

<p>BioSHare is a European FP7 funded project which has a mission to standardize and harmonize data from some of the largest biobanks in Europe. More than 150 selected data elements from 13 European biobanks including UK Biobank,  Lifelines (Neetherlands) and the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Health Study (Norway)  have been harmonized by Maelstrom Research using Opal and corresponding harmonized datasets were derived and stored locally by each cohorts in their Opal database. These databases can be then securely connected to any Mica-based website or DataSHIELD R client to create a federated system of more than 650,000 participants. Using this infrastructure, researchers participating in a collaborative endeavour can log on and securely run distributed queries and statistical analysis on harmonized databases hosted on the geographically-dispersed data computers. Queries available in a Mica-Opal federated infrastructure allows remote retrieval of harmonized data summaries and descriptive statistics such as frequencies/counts, mininimums, maximums, means, standard deviations, as well as contingency tables for each participating research centre in real time.</p>
