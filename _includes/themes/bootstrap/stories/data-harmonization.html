<p>This story is an impressive example of use of the OBIBA software to create a federated database enabling advanced
    analysis without divulging any individual-level data.</p>

<p>BioSHare is a European FP7 funded project which has a mission to standardize and harmonize data from some of the
    largest biobanks in Europe. More than 160 selected data elements from 13 European biobanks including UK Biobank,
    Lifelines (Netherlands) and the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Health Study (Norway) have been harmonized by Maelstrom Research and
    corresponding harmonized datasets were derived and stored locally by each cohorts in their local Opal database.</p>

<p>These databases have been then securely connected to the Mica-based BioSHARE website (bioshare.eu) and to the
    DataSHIELD rstudio client (rstudio.bioshare.eu) to create a federated database system of more than 650,000 European
    subjects. Using this infrastructure, researchers participating in this collaborative endeavour can log on and
    securely run distributed queries and statistical analysis on the harmonized databases hosted on these
    geographically-dispersed data computers. Queries available in a Mica-Opal federated infrastructure allows remote
    retrieval of harmonized data summaries and descriptive statistics such as frequencies/counts, minimums, maximums,
    means, standard deviations, as well as contingency tables for each participating biobank in real time. DataSHIELD
    allows more advanced types of real time analyses such as generalized linear model fitting without disclosing any
    individual-level data.</p>
