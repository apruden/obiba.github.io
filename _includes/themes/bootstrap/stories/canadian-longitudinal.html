<p>The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) project is good example of a productive collaboration between a
    large-scale study and OBiBa. The CLSA is one of the largest Canadian studies on aging. It aims to follow
    approximately 50,000 men and women between the ages of 45 and 85 for at least 20 years and collect information on
    the changing biological, medical, psychological, social, lifestyle and economic aspects of people’s lives.</p>

<p>CLSA and OBiBa have been working closely together to develop new required functionality in Onyx and Opal to support
    CLSA protocols and data management procedures. This includes, for example, a new graphical user interface for
    editing questionnaires, integration of new imaging medical devices, support for videos and sound recording in
    cognitive tests and many more. Onyx is currently deployed in 10 data collection centers across Canada and used as
    well by nurses with laptops for participant’s home interviews.</p>

<p>Data, once collected is daily imported to an Opal central data repository hosted at the McMaster University in
    Hamilton. The repository’s data content is then incrementally exported to a second Opal database used by the CLSA
    analysis center hosted at the Mcgill University in Montreal for data curation and analysis.</p>

<p>Finally, CLSA is currently constructing its data portal using the <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica software <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>.</p>
