<p><a href="http://www.clsa-elcv.ca/" target="_blank">The Canadian Longitudinal Study on aging (CLSA) <i
  class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> (CLSA) project is good example of a productive collaboration between a
  large-scale study and OBiBa. The CLSA aims to follow approximately 50,000 men and women for at least 20 years and
  collect information on the changing biological, medical, psychological, social, lifestyle and economic aspects of
  people’s lives.</p>

<p>CLSA and OBiBa have been working closely together to develop new required functionality in <a
  href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> and <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> to support CLSA protocols and data
  management procedures. This includes a new graphical user interface for editing questionnaires, integration of new
  imaging medical devices, support for videos and sound recording in cognitive tests and many more.</p>

<p>Onyx is currently deployed in 10 data collection centers across Canada and used as well by nurses with laptops for
  participant’s home interviews.</p>

<p>Data collected by Onyx is daily imported to an Opal central data repository hosted at the McMaster University in
  Hamilton. This data is then incrementally exported to the Opal’s CLSA analysis center hosted at the McGill University
  in Montreal for data curation and analysis. As of September 1st, 2014, more than 4.5 terabytes of data is stored in
  CLSA’s Opal databases.</p>

<p>Finally, the CLSA’s data portal is powered by the OBiBa’s <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica software</a>.
