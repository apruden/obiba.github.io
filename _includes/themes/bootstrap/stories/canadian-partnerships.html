<p>The Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow project (CPT) is a long-term research initiative studying the relationship between genetics, environment, and lifestyle as predicting factors for cancer and other chronic conditions. CPT consists of five large Canadian prospective studies: the British Columbia Generations Project, the Tomorrow Project in Alberta, the Ontario Health Study, CARTaGENE in Quebec, and the Atlantic Path. These five cohort studies are set to recruit 300,000 participants nationwide between 2009 and 2012.</p>

<p>The Onyx software application was initially created to assist in collecting baseline data for the CPT project. Developed and configured by a team of 10 OBiBa developers, Onyx was deployed in dozens of assessment centers across Canada. Using Onyx, participants were invited to sign an electronic consent form, answer multiple questionnaires and have taken physical measurements from several medical instruments. Barcoded biological samples were also tracked using Onyx.</p>

<p>In 2013, the collaboration with CPT entered in a new phase, namely with Maelstrom Research whose mandate is to harmonize data collected by the five CPT cohorts and build the CPT national data repository using the Opal and Mica software applications.</p>
