<p><a href="http://www.partnershipagainstcancer.ca/" target="_blank">The Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow</a> project (CPT) is a long-term research initiative on cancer. CPT consists
  of five large Canadian prospective studies that are set to recruit 300,000 participants nationwide between 2009 and
  2012.</p>

<p>The <a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> software application was
  initially created to assist in collecting baseline data for the CPT project. Developed and configured by a team of 10
  OBiBa developers, Onyx was deployed in dozens of assessment centers across Canada. Using Onyx, participants were
  invited to sign an electronic consent form, answer multiple questionnaires and have taken physical measurements from
  several medical instruments. Barcoded biological samples were also tracked using Onyx.</p>

<p>In 2014, the collaboration with CPT entered in a new phase, namely with Maelstrom Research whose mandate is to
  harmonize data collected by the five CPT cohorts and build the CPT national data repository using the <a
