<p>We are pleased to announce that Opal 2.1 is now available. Opal is OBiBa’s core database application
    for biobanks.</p>

<p>The main new features are:</p>
<ul class="obiba-no-style-list">
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>every type of data has a summary (including open text and geolocalisations),
    </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i>DataSHIELD calls are parallelized: instead of waiting for each Opal to answer to the DataSHIELD request, (1) request is first submitted to each Opal and (2) results are fetched afterwards.
    </li>
</ul>
