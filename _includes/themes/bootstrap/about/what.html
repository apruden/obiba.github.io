<p>OBiBa is an international software development project committed to building a full suite of open source
    software for biobanks. It is comprised of several independent and self-funded teams around the world, each
    of which is producing stand-alone applications that support particular biobank activities. The applications
    can be customized and integrated to create a complete biobank information management system.
    OBiBa offers a collaborative infrastructure to its teams and to other developers who may wish to join the
    OBiBa community. The [infrastructure for developers][2] includes integrated tools for documentation, issue
    tracking, deployment, and project management.</p>
<p>As a P3G core project, OBiBa shares P3G's mission of producing tools that facilitate collaboration
    among biobanks and promote data harmonization and sharing. OBiBa software complies with high security
    standards and implements methodologies developed and supported by P3G.
    All software source code is freely available to the biobanking community under the [GPL3 license][4].
