<p>The OBiBa project was funded in 2007 as a core project of the Population Project in Genomics Consortium (P3G).
    Initially funded by Genome Quebec, the project grown rapidly and obtained substantial financial support from its
    main partners to build new open source software applications for data collection and management. In 2012, OBiBa and
    Maelstrom Research joined their effort and teams to develop further the OBiBa suite by integrating new innovative
    tools for data harmonization, federation and dissemination.</p>

<p>OBiBa and Maelstrom Research offices are based in Montreal, Canada at the Research Institute of the McGill
    University Health Center. OBiBa is led by Dr. Vincent Ferretti from the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research.</p>
