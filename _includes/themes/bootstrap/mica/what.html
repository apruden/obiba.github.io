<p>Mica is a powerful software application used to create rapidly web portals for large-scale single epidemiology
    studies or multiple-study consortia. Mica helps studies to provide scientifically robust data visibility and web
    presence without significant information technology effort.</p>

<p>Written as an integrated suite of modules for the Drupal open source content management system, Mica provides a
    structured description of studies, annotated and searchable data dictionaries for both raw and harmonized datasets,
    query interfaces for aggregated and de-identified data, online data access request form management and common page
    structures for publication lists and research events.</p>

<p>Each module can be managed through Drupalâ€™s standard administration screens. Drupal modules from other sources can be
    installed alongside those provided by Mica to build a personalized data portal.</p>
