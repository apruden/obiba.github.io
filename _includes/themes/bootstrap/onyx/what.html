<p>Onyx is a web-based application that manages participant baseline interviews at assessment centres or clinics. As
    depicted in the figure below, an interview is represented as a set of interdependent stages that participants have to go
    through in order to complete their visit (consent form signature, health questionnaire, biosample collection, and so
    on). Onyx stores the data collected during the stages centrally and makes it available to all workstations.</p>

    <p class="help-block">Onyx is a web application that centralizes interview management and data collection
        at an
        assessment centre.</p>
</div>

<p>Onyx controls both the order and availability of the interview stages (for example, no stages are available prior to
    the informed consent is signed) and captures many administrative parameters such as the starting and ending times of
    each stage. Onyx also manages a participant appointment list and reception of participants, as well as data
    filtering and encryption prior to export to a central study database (see <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a>).</p>

<h3>What Onyx Can Do for You</h3>

<p>Onyx is designed to ensure that data is collected in an automated, efficient and secure way in order to minimize
    human errors and interview length. Onyx can optimize the workflow of your baseline interviews by:</p>
<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>Managing appointment lists and walk-ins</li>
    <li>Controlling stage availability and dependencies (examples: requiring consent before an interview can proceed;
        dependent measurements)
    </li>
    <li>Capturing administrative parameters such as starting and ending times of each stage</li>
    <li>Managing participant consents (electronic and handwritten)</li>
    <li>Administering health questionnaires electronically</li>
    <li>Facilitating collection of biosamples (barcode scanning)</li>
    <li>Automating physical measurements</li>
    <li>Producing personalized reports for participants</li>
    <li>Exporting encrypted data to multiple destinations</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Highly Customizable Software Solution</h3>

<p> Onyx is modular as shown in the figure below. The Onyx engine is a backbone to which independent data collection components
    can be connected in order to manage the various interview stages. Studies can configure Onyx for their own specific
    stages and data collection software. </p>

    <p class="help-block">The Onyx engine provides the main functionalities (shown in yellow). Onyx modules
        (orange hexagons)
        collect data for the different stages of an interview.</p>
