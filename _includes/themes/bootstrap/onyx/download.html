<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Before you can use Onyx for your own purposes, it needs extensive configuration to fit your specific needs. Doing so
  requires reading the <a href="http://wiki.obiba.org/display/ONYXDOC" target="_blank">documentation <i
    class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> and editing several files. This
  is a complex operation that is done over several days and possibly weeks depending on the features that need to be
  configured.</p>
