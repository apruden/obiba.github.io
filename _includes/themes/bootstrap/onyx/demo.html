<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Before you can use Onyx for your own purposes, it needs extensive configuration to fit your specific needs. Doing so
    requires reading the <a href="http://wiki.obiba.org/display/ONYXDOC">documentation <i
            class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> and editing several files.
    This is a complex operation that is done over several days and possibly weeks depending on the features that need to
    be configured.</p>

<h3>Onyx Demo</h3>
<p>We've prepared a demo configuration of Onyx that allows you to try out some of the features. Keep in mind that most
    parts of Onyx are configurable, thus what you see in this demo can be completely different if required by your
    use-cases.</p>
<p>To install this Onyx demo locally, follow the instructions provided <a
