    </div>

    <p>Opal's database implements a generalized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">Entity-Attribute-Value <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> (EAV) data model which enables
        to
        store values on an unlimited number of variables without any database structure alterations.
        Customized variable dictionaries are simply defined in Excel files that are then uploaded into
        Opal.
        Here are some of the main features and functionalities of the Opal's database.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Most of the time, researchers need to create research datasets that contain new derived
        variables. For example, a researcher might be interested in the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each
        participant which is obtained by dividing the measured weight by the height. Opal provides all
        the infrastructure to derive new variables as summarized in this list of features.</p>

        <li>Measurement unit conversion</li>
    </ul>
