<p>Opal is OBiBa’s core database application for biobanks or epidemiological studies. Participant data,
    once collected either from OBiBa’s Onyx application or from any other data source, must be
    integrated and stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central
    repository and is typically used by biobank data coordinating centers to manage and analyze
    heterogeneous and anonymized data acquired from different sources and at different points of time
    (Figure 1). Opal can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data collected by
    biobanks.</p>

<p>As a P3G core project, OBiBa shares P3G's mission of producing tools that facilitate collaboration
    among biobanks and promote data harmonization and sharing. OBiBa software complies with high
    security
    standards and implements methodologies developed and supported by P3G.
    All software source code is freely available to the biobanking community under the [GPL3
    license][4].
