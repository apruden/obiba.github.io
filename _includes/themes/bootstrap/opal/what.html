<p>Opal is OBiBa’s core database application for biobanks or epidemiological studies. Participant data,
    once collected either from OBiBa’s <a href="/pages/software/onyx">Onyx <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>
    application or from any other data source, must be integrated and stored in a central data repository under a
    uniform model. Opal is such a central repository and is typically used by biobank data coordinating centers to
    manage and analyze heterogeneous and anonymized data acquired from different sources and at different points of
    time. Opal can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data collected by
    biobanks.</p>

<p>As a P3G core project, OBiBa shares <a href="http://www.p3g.org">P3G's <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>
    mission of producing tools that facilitate collaboration among biobanks and promote data harmonization and sharing.
    OBiBa software complies with high security standards and implements methodologies developed and supported by P3G.
