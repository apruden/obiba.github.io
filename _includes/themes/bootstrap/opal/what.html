<p>Opal is OBiBaâ€™s core database application for biobanks or epidemiological studies. Opal is typically used by studies
    as a central data repository for managing and analyzing heterogeneous and anonymized data acquired from different
    sources and at different points of time (including from the OBIBa <a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx <i
            class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a> application). Opal provides all the necessary
    tools to import, validate, query, analyse and export data collected by studies, build reports, manage participant
    identifiers, data files and more.</p>

<p>As part of the OBiBa suite, Opal is strongly integrated with <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica <i
        class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a> allowing studies to create web data portals that
    can query one or multiple Opal databases to obtain real-time aggregated reports on the exact number of participant
    with specific characteristics or phenotypes.</p>

<p>Moreover, Opal implements the <a href="http://datashield.org" target="_blank">DataSHIELD <i
        class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> method which enables advanced statistical data analysis across
    multiple Opal instances without disclosing any individual-level data.</p>

<p>Opal is built upon a client-server architecture and is offered with multiple clients including a rich graphical web
    application, a R and Python command line clients. Opal is highly scalable and can store very large datasets, thanks
    to its underlying database technologies using MongoDb and ElasticSearch.</p>
