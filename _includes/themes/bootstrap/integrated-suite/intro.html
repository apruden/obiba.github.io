<p>Efficient <b>communication protocols</b> and <b>common data models</b> have been implemented in OBiBa to enable seamless and secure data transfer from one OBiBa application to another. </p>
<p>As a result, OBiBa provides studies with an <b>integrated software</b> infrastructure that supports almost all their data management activities and more.</p>
<p>This OBiBa infrastructure can be used for both individual studies and study consortia.</p>

<p>Obiba offers a unique software solution to support data collection, harmonization and federation. As depicted in the
  figure below:</p>


<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
  <li>data collected from Onyx can be seamlessly exported to study-specific Opal databases.</li>
  <li>each study then uses the Opalâ€™s ability of creating views and derived variables to implement processing
    algorithms that transform data collected by each study into a common (i.e. harmonized) dataset.
  </li>
  <li>making use of Mica and Opal, harmonized data can then be queried and analyzed with the DataSHIELD approach
    through a federated database system, without sending individual-level study data outside of host institutions.
  </li>
</ul>
