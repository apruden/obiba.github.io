<p>Efficient <b>communication protocols</b> and <b>common data models</b> have been implemented in OBiBa to enable seamless and secure data transfer from one OBiBa application to another. </p>
<p>As a result, OBiBa provides studies with an <b>integrated software</b> infrastructure that supports almost all their data management activities and more.</p>
<p>This OBiBa infrastructure can be used for both individual studies and study consortia.</p>

<h3>Individual Study</h3>

<p>An epidemiological study can take advantage of the whole OBiBa's stack.</p>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Data Collection</h4>
<p><a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> can be used to automate data capture (questionnaire answers,
    sound recordings, instrument outputs etc.) and thus ensuring a low level of errors
    (data loss and inconcistencies). <a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> can automatically and securely
    export these data daily. The data dictionary is always associated to the data export, ensuring that no
    information will be lost when interpreting the collected data. The export media can be of different type
    to allow interfacing with various data processing systems:</p>
<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
    <li>XML files (optionally encrypted),</li>
    <li>CSV files,</li>
    <li>Direct secured connection to a <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> server.</li>
</ul>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Data Storage</h4>
<p><a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> is able to store data from <a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> but also
    from other data sources, usually CSV or SPSS files.</p>

<p>The data dictionary can be prepared before or after the data importation. Data can also be transformed by developing
    derivation algorithms for data cleaning and quality checks. The participants' data can also be enriched with other type of information:
    drug registry, geographical area metrics etc.</p>

<p>The specificity of <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> is also that participant identifiers can be
    compartmentalized for a better privacy and to avoid data collusion: the same participant can have one ID in the data
    collected, another one in <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> storage and another one again in the data
    exported to a research group.</p>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Data Analysis</h4>
<p>Data stored in <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a> can be exported to files in common data formats or can be
    pushed on-demand into <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a>
    for performing statistical analysis, graphics and reports.</p>

<h4><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right obiba-small-right-margin"></i> Data Publication</h4>
<p><a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica</a> is the web portal of choice for publishing data dictionaries and aggregated
    results. Out-of-the-box search capabilities of <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica</a> allow researcher to explore
    study's variables and data profiles that could match their project needs. Data access requests can also be submitted
    and evaluated.</p>

<h3>Study Consortia</h3>

<p>Obiba offers a unique software solution to support data collection, harmonization and federation. As depicted in the
  figure below:</p>

<div class="obiba-image-holder">
    {% include themes/bootstrap/image-item.html src='/assets/themes/bootstrap/img/opal-federated.png' header='Federated Database' caption='From data collection to data federation via data harmonization in a study consortia.' %}
</div>

<ul class="obiba-carret-list">
  <li>Data collected from <a href="/pages/products/onyx">Onyx</a> (or from other sources) can be imported into study-specific Opal databases,</li>
  <li>Each study then uses the <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a>â€™s ability of creating views and derived variables to implement processing
    algorithms that transform data collected by each study into a common (i.e. harmonized) dataset,
  </li>
  <li>Making use of <a href="/pages/products/mica">Mica</a> and <a href="/pages/products/opal">Opal</a>, harmonized data
      can then be queried and analyzed with the <a href="/pages/products/datashield">DataSHIELD</a> approach
    through a federated database system, <i>without sending individual-level study data outside of host institutions</i>.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="obiba-top-margin">
  <p>Real examples of such OBiBa federated and harmonized database is described in
      <a class="btn-link" href="/pages/stories">CPTP and BioSHaRE user stories</a>.
  </p>
