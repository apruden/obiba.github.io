<p>Some research projects demand very large sample size for detecting interactions. Such projects usually require
    pooling individual-level data from several studies to obtain this sample size. However, important ethico-legal
    constraints often prevent or impede the sharing of individual-level data across multiple studies.</p>

<p>DataSHIELD aims to address this issue. DataSHIELD is a method that enables advanced statistical analysis of
    individual-level data from several sources without actually pooling the data from these sources together. Visit <a
