<p>Some research projects require pooling data from several studies to obtain sample size large enough for detecting interactions. 
Unfortunately, important ethico-legal constraints often prevent or impede the sharing of individual-level data across multiple studies.</p>

<p>DataSHIELD aims to address this issue. DataSHIELD is a method that enables advanced statistical analysis of
individual-level data from several sources without actually pooling the data from these sources together. 
For more information about the DataSHIELD method, see <a href="http://datashield.org" target="_blank">DataSHIELD.org <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a></p>
    
<p>In collaboration with the DataSHIELD stastistical team in University of Bristol, we implemented <b>DataSHIELD in Opal</b>.</p>
