<p>DataSHIELD enables advanced statistical analysis across a network of Opal databases without the need of pooling and accessing
    individual-level data. This is a powerful tool for studies that canâ€™t share data for common ethico-legal reasons but
    still want to co-analyse in-depth their data in an extensive way.</p>
