    OBiBa is an international project whose mission is to build open source software for epidemiological studies and
    biobanks. Obiba software consists of an integrated suite of software applications that supports end-to-end
    epidemiological data cycle life, from its collection and management to its analysis and dissemination. Our software
    can be used both by individual studies or a networks of studies that want to share their data. Our software is
    developed in close partnership with large-scale studies and consortia such as the Canadian Longitudinal Study on
    Aging (CLSA), the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow (CPT) and BioSHARE.
