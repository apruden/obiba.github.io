                <p>This release fixes bugs for longitudinal studies. You can learn more about the details<a

                <h4><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Important note before upgrading Mica</h4>

                <p>Mica heavily uses <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a> module to capture
                    configuration data, such as entities, fields, variables, views, permissions, etc into code
                    modules.</p>

                <p>In many cases, these Features need to be slightly changed for the specific site you are
                    developing.
                    If you change the base Mica feature, it will be hard to upgrade to a newer version of Mica because
                    your changes would be overwritten.</p>

                <p>What you really want to do is just capture your changes to a site-specific "Override" feature and
                    leave the original distribution untouched. To do so, use <a
                            href="http://drupal.org/project/features_override">Features Override</a> module.

                <p>Please, refer to documentation before upgrading Mica:
