                <hr class="obiba-separator">
                <p>OBiBa is an international software development project committed to building a full suite of open source
                software for biobanks. It is comprised of several independent and self-funded teams around the world, each
                of which is producing stand-alone applications that support particular biobank activities. The applications
                can be customized and integrated to create a complete biobank information management system.
                OBiBa offers a collaborative infrastructure to its teams and to other developers who may wish to join the
                OBiBa community. The [infrastructure for developers][2] includes integrated tools for documentation, issue
                tracking, deployment, and project management.</p>
                <p>As a P3G core project, OBiBa shares P3G's mission of producing tools that facilitate collaboration
                among biobanks and promote data harmonization and sharing. OBiBa software complies with high security
                standards and implements methodologies developed and supported by P3G.
                All software source code is freely available to the biobanking community under the [GPL3 license][4].
                For more information about OBiBa's current projects, see the Software pages of this website.</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>

                <p>The development of an efficient and secure information technology infrastructure is one of the major
                    issues for population-based and case-controls biobanks. Each biobank organization must either outsource
                    development work to IT companies or maintain a team of database administrators, bioinformaticians and
                    programmers to develop new software or adapt existing tools. Either way, each organization reproduces
                    work done by other organizations. Such reinventing of the wheel is time-consuming, wasteful, and runs
                    counter to the spirit of harmonization, communication and sharing among biobanking projects that is
                    currently promoted by international initiatives such as the [P3G][1] consortium. OBiBa was founded to
                    address this issue.</p>
                <h4>OBiBa&#39;s Approach</h4>

                <p>Given the variety and complexity of biobank activities, OBiBa has chosen an approach that is both modular
                    and holistic. It consists of developing standalone applications that can be integrated into a
                    comprehensive information management system for biobanks.</p>

                <p>OBiBa&#39;s applications will support various biobank activities including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subject recruitment</li>
                    <li>Clinical evaluation</li>
                    <li>Biobank sample management</li>
                    <li>Biochemical sample analysis</li>
                    <li>Low and high throughput genotyping</li>
                    <li>Data warehousing</li>
                    <li>Statistical analysis for high data volume</li>
                    <li>Databases federation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The advantages of a modular approach in which each activity is covered by an application capable of
                    running without the others are twofold. First, it simplifies the development process. Second, it allows
                    users to select only the modules they are comfortable using and use other software for other
                    activities.</p>

                <p>OBiBa subscribes to the [open source][2] approach to software development which fosters collaboration
                    among developers, and readily allows software customization and maintenance by giving free access to
                    source code.</p>

                <p>OBiBa software is produced by [teams][3] of experts and developers in different parts of the world. All
                    the teams share the same collaborative vision and use a common set of [resources][4] including a Wiki,
                    an issue-tracking system, a source code repository, and deployment tools.</p>

                <p>OBiBa shares a core belief with P3G, its parent organization: that international collaboration results in
                    better science and better software solutions.</p>
