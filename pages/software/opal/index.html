            <div class="col-xs-6">
                <p>Opal is OBiBa’s core database application for biobanks or epidemiological studies. Participant data,
                    once collected either from OBiBa’s Onyx application or from any other data source, must be
                    integrated and stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central
                    repository and is typically used by biobank data coordinating centers to manage and analyze
                    heterogeneous and anonymized data acquired from different sources and at different points of time
                    (Figure 1). Opal can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data collected by
                    biobanks.</p>

                <p>As a P3G core project, OBiBa shares P3G's mission of producing tools that facilitate collaboration
                    among biobanks and promote data harmonization and sharing. OBiBa software complies with high
                    security
                    standards and implements methodologies developed and supported by P3G.
                    All software source code is freely available to the biobanking community under the [GPL3
                    license][4].

                <p>Opal is a complex and powerful software application for storing and integrating heterogeneous biobank
                    data. We list here some of its key features.</p>
                <h4>Data Warehouse</h4>

                <p>Opal's database implements an generalized Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) data model which enables to
                    store values on an unlimited number of variables without any database structure alterations.
                    Customized variable dictionaries are simply defined in Excel files that are then uploaded into Opal.
                    Here are some of the main features and functionalities of the Opal's database.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Able to integrate multiple sources of data (datasource)</li>
                    <li>Variable dictionary manager</li>
                    <li>Import data in CSV, Excel and Onyx format</li>
                    <li>Connect to existing SQL databases</li>
                    <li>Uniform variable and data representation</li>
                    <li>Any number of variables and entities</li>
                    <li>Any type of "entity"</li>
                    <li>Statistical summary</li>
                </ul>
